        <![CDATA[<h3>FeedJSON</h3>

<p>FeedJSON is a new format to offer simple and easy consumption of syndication feeds. Currently all
syndication is based on either RSS or ATOM formats which are complex XML -formats which doesnâ€™t fir
to modern world anymore. More and more development platforms are having easy, native JSON support,
reading JSON data to your own application is as simple as calling one method, but consuming XML is
either writing XML parser from scratch or trying to find proper suitable library that somebody else
has already.</p>

<p>For syndication needs, FeedJSON offers simple standardised way to offer same information as RSS
feeds gives away, but in a easy to consume format with JSON format.</p>

<h3>Application Support</h3>

<p>Currently FeedJSON is supported by following services and applications:</p>
